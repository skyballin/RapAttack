# RapKilla
Bad Word Replacer 
- Download all files, conda/pip install all imports, run through Flask, and have fun! Will definitely
add more elements to the app in the future. 

- Description: This app asks for you to enter a link to a song on rapgenius.com and then replaces the
bad words in those lyrics with random lyrics from John Denver songs. 
- This was all done through a little webscraping, some Python programming, and some Flask implementation.
